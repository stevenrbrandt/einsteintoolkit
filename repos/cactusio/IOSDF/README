1. Purpose

This thorn does 1D, 2D, and 3D output of grid variables in SDF file format.

1D output slices through the edge (in octant mode) or center
(in all origin-centered modes) of the grid in the x,y, and z directions.
If the grid is cubed it will also slice in the diagonal direction.

2D output is done for the xy, xz, and yz plane.

3D output is simply done for the full 3D grid variables.

The IO methods "IOSDF_1D", "IOSDF_2D", and "IOSDF_3D" are registered 
which can be called by other thorns via CCTK_OutputVarAsByMethod()
to output a variable without specifying it in the parameter file.
