1. Purpose

GiRaFFE solves the equations of General Relativistic 
Force-Free Electrodynamics (GRFFE) using a high-resolution shock capturing scheme.
It is based on IllinoisGRMHD, which is a rewrite of the Illinois Numerical Relativity 
(ILNR) group's GRMHD code.

GiRaFFE is particularly good at modeling black hole magnetospheres. Its 
conservative-to-primitive solver has also been modified to check the 
physicality of conservative variables prior to primitive inversion, and move them 
into the physical range if they become unphysical.

Currently GiRaFFE consists of
1) the Piecewise Parabolic Method (PPM) for reconstruction, 
2) the Harten, Lax, van Leer (HLL/HLLE) approximate Riemann solver, and
3) a modified HARM Conservative-to-Primitive solver. 

GiRaFFE evolves the vector potential A_{\mu} (on staggered grids) 
instead of the magnetic fields (B^i) directly, to guarantee that the 
magnetic fields will remain divergenceless even at AMR boundaries. On 
uniform resolution grids, this vector potential formulation produces 
results equivalent to those generated using the standard, staggered 
flux-CT scheme. This scheme is based on that of Del Zanna (2003, see
below OPTIONAL CITATION #1).
