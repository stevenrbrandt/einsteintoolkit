Cactus Code Thorn Seed_Magnetic_Fields
Author(s)    : Zachariah B. Etienne
Note         : This thorn is designed to seed magnetic 
               fields into initial data. Generally, these
               magnetic fields are sufficiently weak that
               there is no significant dynamical impact
               initially.

1. Purpose

Seed magnetic fields into an initial matter configuration.
Currently seeding into TOV stars is supported, according
to the poloidal magnetic field prescription:
A_x = -y*A_b*pow(MAX(P-P_cut,0.0),n_s)
A_y =  x*A_b*pow(MAX(P-P_cut,0.0),n_s)
A_z = 0
Phi = 0

as specified in Appendix B of the IllinoisGRMHD code
announcement paper:
http://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.07276.pdf

Note that we must be careful if A_i's are staggered. In this
case, the pressure must be interpolated to the staggered
point, and the values of x and y must also be shifted.
