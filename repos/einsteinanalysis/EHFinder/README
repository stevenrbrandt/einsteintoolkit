Purpose of the thorn:

To find the event horizon of a numerical spacetime by integrating a null
surface backwards in time.

The surface will be parametrized as the 0 value isosurface of a level
set function. This ensures that it is possible to handle cases when the
topology changes (when evolving backwards in time) from one common event
horizon to two (or more) individual event horizons.


Documentation:

The documentation can be found in the Thorn Guide provided with this
Thorn. For additional details see gr-qc/0305039.


History:
