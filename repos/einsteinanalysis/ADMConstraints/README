1. Purpose

This analysis thorn calculates the violation in the ADM constraints using 
the standard Einstein variables. 

2. Includes

ADMConstraints is symmetry boundaries, conformal factor and matter
aware. Matter is included with the CalcTmunu mechanism.

3. Output

Hamiltonian constraint: ham, hamnormalized
Momentum constraints: momx, momy, momz

4. All variables are synchronized on output of the analysis routines
   before output.
