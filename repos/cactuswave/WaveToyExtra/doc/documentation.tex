\section{Introduction}

This thorn contains enhancements to the standard WaveToy thorns for 
modelling 3D scalar fields. WaveToy is primarily intended as a 
example thorn and for that reason is deliberately kept as simple
as practical, with more advanced features included here instead. 
Currently this thorn shows how more flexible boundaries can be 
used with WaveToy or other thorns.

\section{Boundary Conditions}

This thorn provides the infrastructure to use any registered 
external boundary condition with WaveToy, with any choice of options.
