Purpose of the thorn:

Compute norms of the state vector, e.g. for Mexico tests.  These are
special norms that make a difference between variables which have a
second derivative taken and variables which have not; see
gr-qc/0503056.  These norms include the gradients of those variables
that have a second derivative taken.  In doing so, they take all
wavelenghts into account -- in contrast, a norm that would be based
simply on using centered differences to calculate gradients would not.
