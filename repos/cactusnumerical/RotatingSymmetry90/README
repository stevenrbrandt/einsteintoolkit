1. Purpose

Provide a 90 degree rotational symmetry boundary condition.  This is
the kind of symmetry that exists e.g. in a single black hole evolution
when the black hole has spin.  The same setup also admits an
additional bitant symmetry.

Currently the symmetry is fixed to be located at the lower x and y
boundaries, so that there is a rotation about the z axis.

The coordinate thorn does not know about this symmetry.  You will have
to set up the domain such that you have an upper quadrant in the x and
y directions.

This symmetry boundary condition can be mixed with arbitrary symmetry
conditions in the z direction, e.g. bitant or periodicity.
