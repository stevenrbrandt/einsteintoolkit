--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Purpose of the thorn:

Make it possible to use the file reader to read initial data for the
ADM variables.  This checks whether the ADM variables are actually
supposed to be read, so that it is impossible to actually leave
something uninitialised.  However, read errors are not caught.
