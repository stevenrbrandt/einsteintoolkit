Organization of these test files:

"xeon" stands for the rounding errors that I detected for the
conspiration compiler-precessor in these machines.

Thus I have preserved the "test" files designed for Einstein 1.

"E2" Stands for the version converted for Einstein 2.

------

How these work:

Comparing the directories test vs xeon_test you will notice
the rounding error I just mentioned.....

Comparing xeon_test vs E2xeon_test you won't notice any
difference, since both were configured for the conspiracy 
xeon-?compiler .... this is my test for the conversion
from Einstein 1 to Einstein 2 .... it was done on xeon04....

I could add a test later carried out in other machines 
and update this information too.... I'll need to ask Ryoji 
where he compiled the test.....
