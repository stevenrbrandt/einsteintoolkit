Description of files in this directory
======================================

$Header$

This directory is an archive of old files from this thorn, which are
no longer used.  By keeping them here instead of or in addition to the
CVS 'attic' we make them readily accessible; in particular it's easy
to use 'ls' to see what's here, grep this directory, etc etc.
