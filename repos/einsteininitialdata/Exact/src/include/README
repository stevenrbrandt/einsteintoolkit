Description of files in this directory
======================================

$Header$

Scalar_CalcTmunu.inc
	This code is included into evolution thorns via the
	"uses include source" mechanism, to add the thorn Exact
	contributions on to the stress-energy tensor.  Note that
	this means this code is compiled in the context of evolution
	thorns, *not* as part of this thorn.  As such, this code does
	*not* have access to this thorns' private/restricted parameters;
	to work around this we copy the parameters to protected grid
	scalars with "___" names.

Scalar_CalcTmunu_temps.inc
	This code is included into evolution thorns via the
	"uses include" mechanism, to declare temporary variables
	used by the code in "Scalar_CalcTmunu.inc"

param_defs.inc
	This contains #define definitions for the various possible
	values of decoded_exact_model ; if #defines are needed for
	other decoded keyword/string parameters they should also
	live here.

slice_normal.inc
	This contains a fragment of Fortran code to compute the
	normal vector to a slice.

Exact.inc
	Misc Fortran definitions for the whole thorn.
