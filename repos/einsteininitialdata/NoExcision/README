--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Purpose of the thorn:

Overwrite the regions near a singularity with "something else",
possibly flat space, ignoring the constraints.  This is instead of
excision.

This method is modelled after an idea by Denis Pollney, following an
serendipitous bug by Ian Hawke.  The word "serendipity" was coined by
Horace Walpole in the 18th century, from the Persian fairy tale "The
Three Princes of Serendip" (www.wikipedia.org).
