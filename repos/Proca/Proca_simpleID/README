1. Purpose

Create initial data for a black hole surrounded by a Proca field with mass
mu. This is the "Simple Initial Data" construction from paper
"Nonlinear interactions between black holes and Proca fields",

This is a spherically symmetric configuration, but due to how the initial data
is constructed the parameter par_b cannot be exactly zero. Choosing a very small
value for it (like the default choice) typically works very well at producing
spherically symmetric data.


In addition, when the mass of the Proca field is zero, this thorn can also
accommodate for initial data describing two black holes with the same
charge-to-mass ratio momentarily at rest, used in paper
"Collisions of charged black holes",
