\begin{abstract}
Thorn {\bf IOHDF5Util} provides functionality to implement HDF5 I/O in Cactus.
\end{abstract}

\section{Purpose}
Thorn {\bf IOHDF5Util} provides common routines which can be used to implement
Cactus I/O methods for input/output of Cactus variables in the HDF5 standard
(Hierarchical Data Format Version 5).

Currently, {\bf IOHDF5Util} is inherited by the {\bf IOHDF5} and
{\bf IOStreamHDF5} I/O thorns which share its routines to implement their own
I/O methods doing parallel HDF5 file I/O and online HDF5 data streaming.

\section{Building A Cactus Configuration with {\bf IOHDF5Util}}
%
The Cactus distribution does not contain the HDF5 header files and library which
is used by thorn {\bf IOHDF5Util}. So you need to configure it as an external
software package via:
%
\begin{verbatim}
  make <configuration>-config HDF5=yes
                             [HDF5_DIR=<path to HDF5 package>]
\end{verbatim}
%
The configuration script will look in some default places for an installed
HDF5 package. If nothing is found this way you can explicitly specify it with
the {\tt HDF5\_DIR} configure variable.
