1. Purpose

This thorn provides a very simple I/O method which prints the values of
three-dimensional Cactus grid functions and arrays at a chosen location
(selected by parameters) to screen.

The I/O method makes use of the Cactus Hyperslabbing API to obtain the data
values to print.

The code in this thorn is well documented and can be used as an example to 
build your own I/O method.
