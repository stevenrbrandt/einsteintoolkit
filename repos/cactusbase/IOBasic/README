1. Purpose

This thorn provides two I/O methods "Info" and "Scalar" which output grid
variables as scalars as a function on time.

Grid scalars:
 - Output the value of the scalar straight forwardly

Grid functions:
 - Output the reduction value of the grid function versus time.
   For this you also need to activate a thorn which implements reduction
   operators (eg. PUGHReduce which provides the standard reductions
   "minimum", "maximum", "sum", "norm1", "norm2", and "norm_inf").


The "Info" method would print the values, along with the current iteration
number and the physical time, in a formatted table to stdout.

The "Scalar" methods outputs to ASCII files which can be processed with
gnuplot or xgraph.


2. Additional information

There is more comprehensive documention available in this thorn's
doc/documentation.tex file which is included in the Cactus Thorn Guide.
