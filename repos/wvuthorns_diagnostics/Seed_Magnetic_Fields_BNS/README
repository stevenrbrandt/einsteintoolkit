Cactus Code Thorn Seed_Magnetic_Fields_BNS
Author(s)    : Zachariah B. Etienne
Note         : The thorn on which this is based,
               WVUThorns/Seed_Magnetic_Fields,
               seeds magnetic fields within a single star.
               This thorn simply extends the capability to
               two stars, centered at (x,y,z)=(x_c1,0,0)
               and (x,y,z)=(x_c2,0,0) (LORENE sets up the
               neutron stars along the x-axis by default).
