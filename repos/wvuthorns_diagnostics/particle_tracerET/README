Cactus Code Thorn particle_tracerET

Note         : particle_tracerET tracks the motion of test particles
               that comove with fluid flows. As magnetic field
               lines remain attached to the fluid elements they
               thread in the MHD approximation, this thorn provides
               essential functionality for self-consistent
               visualizations of the dynamics of magnetic field lines
               (i.e., magnetic field vector streamlines) over time in
               a GRMHD simulation.

               Magnetic field lines can be visualized by first
               picking a fluid element (i.e., a point in space at
               which the fluid density and magnetic fields are
               nonzero), and then generating the vector field
               streamline according to the magnetic field vector.

               The instantaneous velocity of these test particles
               is given by the velocity in the induction equation
               v^i = u^i/u^0 at the location of each test particle,
               so this thorn tracks particle dynamics by solving
               the ODEs:

               dx/dt = v^x
               dy/dt = v^y
               dz/dt = v^z

               subject to the initial conditions
               x(0)=x_0
               y(0)=y_0
               z(0)=z_0.

               The above IVP is solved for each particle using
               an RK4 ODE integration, interpolating the velocity
               vector at each particle position, at each RK4
               substep. The frequency of RK4 substeps generally
               can be far lower than that of the global simulation
               RK substepping, and is set to be every "update_RK4_freq"
               cctk_iteration's.
               
               The velocities v^i = u^i/u^0 are computed using as
               inputs the HydroBase velocity and ADMBase spacetime
               metric variables. particle_tracerET stores v^i to
               MHDvx,MHDvy,MHDvz.
