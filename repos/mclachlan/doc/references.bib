%%%%% Instructions %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Here are some instructions for modifying or extending this file.  This
% file is used by many people, for many existing latex documents.  This
% file is used by people all over the world, and has been used for many
% years.  It therefore very important that your changes do not break
% these existing documents.  Thank you.
% 
% 
% 
% Here are the important rules.  If you break them, people will become
% angry.
% 
% -- Never remove an entry.  If you don't want people to use a certain
%    entry any more, add a comment in front of it stating so.  If you
%    remove an entry, existing papers won't latex any more.
% 
% -- Never remove fields from entries.  Someone may need this field, and
%    the generated reference is then missing critical information.
%    Worse, that may go unnoticed for a long time, e.g. when a revised
%    version is sent to the referee.
% 
% -- If an entry doesn't look nice in your references, don't change the
%    entry just to make it look nice.  It is likely that your changes
%    will make it look ugly for other people.  Instead, change your
%    bibtex style, or create your own.  (This is easy; see
%    <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibTeX> for instructions.)
% 
% -- If you absolutely cannot live with an existing entry, then
%    duplicate it with a new name.  This is an ugly solution, but at
%    least it guarantees that you don't break anything.  Please add a
%    comment describing the differences, or telling people which entry
%    to use in general.
% 
% -- Do not add new fields to entries that will dramatically change how
%    these entries are printed.  For example, the "note" field is always
%    printed, which means that you should only put information there
%    that is always interesting -- even in a PRL where every line
%    counts.  Do not use the "note" field to add some information that
%    belongs into other fields, e.g. "eprint".  If you want to see
%    eprint numbers, you can change bibtex style instead (see above).
% 
% -- In general, do not add a "key" field to your entries.  The "key"
%    field is definitely not meant to be a repetition of the key (the
%    thingy you use in the \cite command).  Instead, the "key" field is
%    e.g. used to sort entries when no author is specified.  Some bibtex
%    styles also output the key into the reference (i.e., they generate
%    "[key]" instead of "[42]" in the paper.  Unless you really want to
%    use this feature, don't add keys.  In particular, don't add keys with
%    underscores, which lead to latex errors.
% 
% -- In spite of the above, please do update references that are
%    outdated, e.g. because they have been published, or they contain an
%    error, or you have additional information for that entry (e.g. an
%    eprint number or a URL).  It is okay to change a references
%    substantially when a preprint has been published.
% 
% 
% 
% And here are some rules of minor importance.
% 
% - If you want to add an eprint number, use an "eprint" field.
% 
% - If an article has not been published yet, then it should not be
%   declared as "Article".  You should probably use "Unpublished"
%   instead.  This is necessary because published articles are
%   sometimes only listed with their journal information and without
%   eprint information.  This does obviously not work for preprints:
%   this produces then citations like "[42] J. Baker (2007)" which are
%   incomplete.
% 
% - If you want to add a URL, use a "url" field.  URLs in "url" fields
%   do not need to be quoted in any way.  If you add URLs pointing
%   to arxiv.org, note that they request that you point to the paper's
%   abstract, not directly to the PDF document.  You may need to use
%   "\usepackage{url}" for these urls, or you may need to update your
%   bibtex style.  However, URLs printed from the "url" field look much
%   nicer.  They can even have line breaks.  Spaces in urls are ignored,
%   so please add spaces to break urls into shorter, manageable pieces --
%   bibtex cannot handle urls which are too long.
% 
% - We usually create keys of the form "last name of first author",
%   "year", "letter".  Examples are "Abel97a" or "Abbott:2006vg".  Try
%   to follow a similar rule.  Don't make the key too long.
% 
% - Try to avoid adding one-time entries, e.g. for "private
%   communication".  Consider instead using a second bibtex file that
%   is distributed with your paper.  You can use several bibtex files
%   together by listing them all in the same \bibliography command,
%   separated by commas, without spaces.
% 
% - Keep the entries sorted.  (I don't know why I have to mention this
%   here, but it seems to be necessary.)
% 
% - Before you commit, run bibtex at least once to make sure that there
%   are no errors.  (This should also go without saying.)
% 
% - If you find yourself using bibtex a lot, consider reading some
%   documentation, e.g. starting from
%   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibTeX>.

                Eardley uses a 'beads on a string' technique to

                imagining the curve to be defined as a bead on

                positions on each ray at which the relation is

            The Binary Black Hole Alliance was formed to study the
            collision of black holes and the resulting gravitational
            radiation by computationally solving Einstein's equations
            for general relativity. The location of the black hole
            surface in a head-on collision has been determined in
            detail and is described here. The geometrical features
            that emerge are presented along with an analysis and
            explanation in terms of the spacetime curvature inherent
            in the strongly gravitating black hole region. This
            curvature plays a direct, important, and analytically
            explicable role in the formation and evolution of
            the event horizon associated with the surfaces of the
            black holes.
