A suite of spacetime codes.

The code is generated with Kranc
<http://numrel.aei.mpg.de/Research/Kranc/>
<http://www.cct.lsu.edu/~eschnett/Kranc/>, which requires Mathematica.
The code also requires Cactus <http://www.cactuscode.org/> and Carpet
<http://www.carpetcode.org/>.

We thank all authors of Cactus and Kranc for these fine tools.
