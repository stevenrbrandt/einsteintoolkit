1. Purpose

LeanBSSNMoL evolves Einstein's Equations with the BSSN formulation. For the
conformal factor it uses the "W" version, i.e. W=\gamma^{-1/6}, and it employs
the usual "1+log" and "Gamma-driver" gauge conditions. Also available, in the
"new_gauge" branch, is the shift condition of Figueras et al for their
evolutions of higher dimensional BHs, see:
