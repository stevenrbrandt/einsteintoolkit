Building and Testing Cactus at NMI <https://nmi.cs.wisc.edu/>

Erik Schnetter, 2010-02-10



This directory contains scripts and input files for checking out,
building, and testing Cactus at the NMI Build and Test Lab
<https://nmi.cs.wisc.edu/>.



Instructions:

1. You will need an account at NMI.  Go to <https://nmi.cs.wisc.edu/>
   and follow the instructions to obtain an account.

2. Check out this repository (i.e., the Cactus Utilities repository)
   on one of the NMI front ends.

3. Submit the main test script "wavetoy.submit" with the command

   nmi_submit wavetoy.submit

4. Watch the progress on the web page
   <http://nmi-web.cs.wisc.edu/nmi/index.php?page=results/overview>.
   You may want to choose the project "Cactus" to narrow down the
   results.

5. After the test is complete you will receive an email containing a
   report.  This report is currently sent to <schnetter@cct.lsu.edu>;
   this email address is specified in the submission script
   "wavetoy.submit".

6. Note that submission scripts can be set to auto-resubmit.  If this
   is set, then you should obviously not submit the script more than
   once.  Type
   
   condor_q <USER-ID>
   
   to see what jobs you have in the queue, and use
   
   condor_rm <JOB-ID>
   
   to delete them.
