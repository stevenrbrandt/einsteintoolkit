There is a parameter steering interface, which is accessed by
including http_Steer.h.

This defines two functions:


int HTTP_SteerQueue(const char *thorn, 
                    const char *parameter, 
                    const char *value);

which schedules a parameter to be steered, and

int HTTP_SteerDispatch(void);

which broadcasts the data to other processors and then
steers all the parameters which were queued.

This is to allow steering requests to be queued up over several
iterations, and then broadcast at once, which should reduce the
number of barriers called by the code.
