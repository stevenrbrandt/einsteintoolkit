Purpose of the thorn:

Gravitational wave extraction using gauge-invariant perturbations of
Schwarzschild with the Zerilli-Moncrief and Cunningham-Price-Moncrief
formalisms.

History:

The thorn was originally Extract (found in EinsteinAnalysis), which
used the Zerilli-Moncrief and Regge-Wheeler variables.  Many features
were added to Extract, and it was cut down to form WaveExtract
(AEIDevelopment).  WaveExtract was then modified to work with
ADMDerivatives (and hence Llama), to implement OpenMP paralellisation,
and support for some old features such as corotating coordinates was
removed.  WaveExtractL was then modified to replace the RW variable
with the CPM variable, which does not need time integration to get the
GW strain for the odd-parity modes.

IMPORTANT: The old version in AEIDevelopment/WaveExtract is NOT
           working with general coordinates (especially radial
           stretching)!!  Use this thorn instead!
