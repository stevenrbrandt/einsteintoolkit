File: analytic 
Author: Nils Dorband

perl script that was helpful to me when comparing multipatch data with
analytic solutions.

It reads x y and z coordinates from Carpet output files (like
x.0.xz.asc for example), calculates the analytic solution at these
coordinates and outputs it together with the coordinates.

The output has the same length as the original Carpet output files, so
one can "paste" it together with the Carpet output files to plot
differences or similar things with gnuplot.

I am thinking about making this thing more userfriendly, but probably
there are more important things to do.
