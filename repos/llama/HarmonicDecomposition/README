--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Purpose of the thorn:

This thorn is ment to replace LSUDevelopment/SphericalHarmonics.
It is more general with respect to extraction spheres (spheres don't need
to have constant coordinate radius!)
and is based on SphericalSlice.
