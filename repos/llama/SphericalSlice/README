Purpose of the thorn:

This thorn is ment as a generalization and replacement of SphericalSurface.

Instead of defining the parameters of a surface alone, this thorn will also manage the storage of 
the spherical slices so that other thorns doesn't need to do that themselves which makes it
possible to parallelize the spherical slices efficiently once and for all.
It also provides commonly used functions such as surface integration, decomposition, etc.



TODO:
Synchronize only among those processors which are assigned for one sphere ->
create a MPI communicator for each slice.

6patches:
Interpolation rouutines need to make use of Carpet's fasterp!

6patches:
Maybe before integrating interpolate to a point with standard spherical coordinates 
and then do the Gauss sum. The incomplete function "interpolate(theta, phi)"
could be used for that. Basically one would loop over spherical coordinates
and before summing the current point, it will be first interpolated.
OR:
Use coefficients of diagonal SBP norms since they define
integration coefficients of up to 8th-order. 


Currently, interp-setup is forgotten whenever regridding occurs.
It would however be much wiser to check which spheres intersect moving grids
and forget about interpolation only about those.
