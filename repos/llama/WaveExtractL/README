--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Purpose of the thorn:

Does Wave extraction and only wave extraction using the Zerilli formalism.
This thorn was formerly Extract, but that got overloaded with lots of stuff.



NOTE:

This thorn is a modification to the original WaveExtract as found in
AEIDevelopment and has been extended to be OMP parallel and to use
CarpetInterp2.  Some features as working with corotating coordinates
have been removed.

IMPORTANT: The old version in AEIDevelopment/WaveExtract is NOT
           working with general coordinates (especially radial
           stretching)!!  Use this thorn instead!
