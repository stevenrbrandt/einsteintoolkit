1. Purpose

Distribute the Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines (BLAS); see
<http://netlib.org/blas/>.



From the web site:

The BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) are routines that provide
standard building blocks for performing basic vector and matrix
operations.  The Level 1 BLAS perform scalar, vector and vector-vector
operations, the Level 2 BLAS perform matrix-vector operations, and the
Level 3 BLAS perform matrix-matrix operations.  Because the BLAS are
efficient, portable, and widely available, they are commonly used in
the development of high quality linear algebra software, LAPACK for
example.
