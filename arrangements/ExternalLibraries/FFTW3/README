1. Purpose

Distribute the FFTW Library; see <http://www.fftw.org/>.



From the web site: FFTW is a C subroutine library for computing the
discrete Fourier transform (DFT) in one or more dimensions, of
arbitrary input size, and of both real and complex data (as well as of
even/odd data, i.e. the discrete cosine/sine transforms or DCT/DST).
We believe that FFTW, which is free software, should become the FFT
library of choice for most applications.

Our benchmarks, performed on on a variety of platforms, show that
FFTW's performance is typically superior to that of other publicly
available FFT software, and is even competitive with vendor-tuned
codes. In contrast to vendor-tuned codes, however, FFTW's performance
is portable: the same program will perform well on most architectures
without modification. Hence the name, "FFTW," which stands for the
somewhat whimsical title of "Fastest Fourier Transform in the West."

The FFTW package was developed at MIT by Matteo Frigo and Steven G.
